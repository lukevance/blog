I‚Äôll admit it: I‚Äôve spent a lot of time thinking about APIs over the past decade. To most people, APIs and webhooks might sound like developer jargon, but for product managers, understanding how they work can be a game-changer. 

These tools are the backbone of modern applications, powering everything from real-time notifications to seamless integrations. By learning how to test and use them, PMs can bridge the gap between product and engineering, validate ideas faster, and even troubleshoot issues independently. This is not the same as learning to code or becoming a developer, but it will unlock a whole new level of capabilities for any PM, most especially those working on "embeddable" products, or software sold as as an API. 

Recently, I had the opportunity to lead a workshop designed to give product managers hands-on experience with APIs and webhooks. My goal was simple: demystify these technical concepts and make them approachable‚Äîeven for those who don‚Äôt write code every day.

## ‚öíÔ∏è The Workshop

The workshop was structured to deliver three key outcomes for attendees:

1. **Understand the Basics:** Gain a foundational understanding of APIs and webhooks before testing real-world integrations.

2. **Hands-On Experience:** Make API calls, test webhooks, and simulate actual product scenarios.

3. **Build Confidence:** Leave with practical skills and a clear sense of progress

I wanted attendees to get hands on immediately during our on-site session. So in preparation I needed them to learn the basics, including how to send requests, understand responses and reveive a webhook. I also needed to make sure they had setup the tools they‚Äôd use during the session. So I created¬†an interactive preparation guide that walked them through the basics and tracked their progress.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Zero-to-Hero: Learning by Doing

The prep-work emphasized a short feedback loop: participants could see their progress in real-time. Here's what we covered:

- Sending **GET** and **POST** requests to interact with APIs.
- Testing webhooks by triggering them and observing how responses were handled.
- Debugging to identify issues and understand how to solve them.

Each step built on the last, reinforcing their understanding and confidence. The highlight of course was the dynamic leaderboard that tracked their progress leading up to the session, adding a layer of friendly competition and motivation.

## ü•≥ Learning Is Fun! (When Progress is Quick)

The most rewarding part of the workshop was seeing how much the PMs enjoyed learning and progressing. A short feedback loop and tangible results kept them engaged, and by the end of the session, they were all running real-world tests, triggering webhooks, and simulating merchant interactions. This reaffirmed my belief: with the right setup and encouragement, anyone can develop technical skills‚Äîand have fun doing it!

## ü§ô What‚Äôs Next?

I‚Äôm so glad you asked! If you‚Äôre interested, you too can join the fun! The prep guide is clearly aimed at preparing for an event, but all the setup steps and notes are available publicly [here](https://provolove.notion.site/APIs-for-Normies-169e51fa9e9b81dfb610e00fecf1a84a). Whether you‚Äôre a PM, a curious developer, or just looking to up your tech game, this is your chance to dive in and learn by doing.
