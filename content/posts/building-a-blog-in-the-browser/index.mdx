So I just built this website without ever leaving my browser. 

"Cool, Luke, have you ever heard of Wordpress? Or Squarespace, or Webflow or any other website builder out there?"

Fair enough. Yes, I have. But I wanted to build a website with proper developer tooling and lifecycle management. One that _could_ become a more capable web app someday if it needed to be. I wanted to know if I _could_ build a "serious" web app without leaving the browser. I know a horde of peple with much more successful websites than I'll ever have are currently sharpening there pitchforks, whatever come and get me.

My criteria were:

1. Own and manage the code - the source code is in my own github repo
2. [React](www.reactjs.com)-based - be able to import and add React components to the site and maybe even my blog posts
3. Integrated data sources - import posts from Notion or let users comment or something else fun


Well it went pretty well, here's the blog! I'll add more about the process asap

To be updated soon
