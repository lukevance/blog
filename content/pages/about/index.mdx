Modern tooling has made building digital experiences and distributing them globally easier than ever. Yet, software engineering still gets complicated quickly. Whether you are creating a no-code app or evaluating the [cloud native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) for your enterprise-grade platform, conducting user research and mapping human experiences is the short cut to real-world impact.

## Hi! I'm Luke Vance.

I'm a product manager, builder, investor and optimist. I'm also a dad, a long-distance runner, and a part-time after-hours developer tooling explorer.

## Operating Principles

I adore new challenges, open spaces full of risk and unknown. Processes and constraints help breed innovative environments but I thrive in a moderate level of chaos.

With a multi-cultural, interdisciplinary background, I believe in the power of ethnography and well-researched design, but magical experiences come from building rapidly, constantly experimenting and iterating intentionally. 

By default I assume the best in people and that any problem can be solved. Our world is facing some ominous challenges, but I believe building the best possible tools for builders can ultimately lead to even more surprising solutions.
