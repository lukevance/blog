## Learning Resources & Workshops

Welcome to the Learning Hub! This is where I share resources, guides, and workshops designed to help product managers, builders, and curious minds level up their technical skills.

### Featured Workshops

#### 🚀 APIs for Normies

An interactive workshop designed to demystify APIs and webhooks for product managers. No coding experience required—just curiosity and a willingness to learn.

**What you'll learn:**
- Send GET and POST requests to interact with APIs
- Test webhooks and understand how they work
- Debug issues and build confidence with technical tools
- Bridge the gap between product and engineering

### Learning Philosophy

I believe the best way to learn technical concepts is through **hands-on experimentation with short feedback loops**. My workshops and resources are designed to:

- Get you building immediately
- Provide quick wins and visible progress
- Make technical concepts approachable
- Show you how to apply skills to your actual work
